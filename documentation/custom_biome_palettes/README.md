In vanilla Minecraft, grass and leaf textures vary in color depending on the biome each block resides in. 
This is controlled by two files:

```
~assets/minecraft/textures/colormap/grass.png
~assets/minecraft/textures/colormap/foliage.png
```

Each file is a 256x256 colormap applied to the base grass and leaf textures, which are usually grey. OptiFine greatly expands this functionality to apply to virtually any number of blocks, as well as sky and fog colors. Artists can use this to great effect to give each biome its own feel.
