</div>

In Minecraft 1.5, Mojang added the ability to animate any block or item texture. 
Unfortunately, this did not include other textures, such as mob skins and GUIs. OptiFine fills this gap, enabling almost any non-block/item texture to be animated. This even includes textures for other OptiFine features, 
such as Random Entities and Custom Sky.

**Please Note:** This CANNOT be used for block and item textures, including CTM and CIT. You should continue to use Mojang's .mcmeta file method.
